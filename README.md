# PokemonApi
# Learning goals

I would like to present you a Pokemon Api. Get data about pokemons, their moves, trainers and gyms they beaten. Try out one of two features allowing to fight or catch a pokemon. Below is a list with endpoints You can use:
 
- # Catch pokemon
     - /api/trainers/catch_pokemon?trainerId={trainerId}&pokemonId={pokemonId} - use this endpoint to simulate trainer's attempt to catch pokemon.

- # Fight another trainer
     - /api/fight?trainer1={trainer1Id}&trainer2={trainer2Id} - use this endpoint to simulate fight between two trainers with given id's. Trainer whose pokemons have moves with better attackDamage wins.
